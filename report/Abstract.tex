\section*{Abstract}
Network protocols are a set of rules that strictly define the order and content of messages passed between users over a network. Often these protocols are used to define how to establish a secure and encrypted connection. As these protocols grow in complexity, it becomes increasingly complicated to implement them. Making matters worse is ensuring that the implementation adheres to the rules of the protocol. Dealing with these issues can cause implementations to become complicated and obscure a systems properties. Specifically the work flow of the system will become arcane as only a limited few will know its inner workings.
\\\\
In this paper we will create a domain specific language that captures this complexity. The DSL will provide the syntax needed for precisely defining a protocol. We will then use this definition as a foundation for the protocols implementation.
