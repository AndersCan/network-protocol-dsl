\section*{Appendix A: How to run}
To run the project only one tool is required, Simple Build Tool. SBT can be downloaded and installed from \href{http://www.scala-sbt.org/}{http://www.scala-sbt.org/}

When sbt is installed you need to navigate to the project folder containing ``build.sbt'' and run ``sbt''. This will download all dependencies and start the sbt console. 

Simply type ``run'' here to compile and start the application. There are two main files within the applications that you can start, the Server and Client for the secure chat application.
